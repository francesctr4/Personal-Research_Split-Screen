# Personal Research: Split Screen <br> by Francesc Teruel Rodríguez

## Description

This project is part of the Project II subject, on the second year of the Videogame Design and Development degree, taught at CITM UPC (Terrassa) and supervised by pedro omedas.

It consists of choosing a theme, developing it and presenting it, in my case this theme is the split screen.

# About Me

I am a student of video game design and development, with a flair for learning new technologies.
What I am best at is at anything related with code and programming, which is my preferred role at the projects done in university.
I would also love to be able to do something related to 3D modelling.
