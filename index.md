## Our project

This project consists in the replication of the 1994 Windjammers arcade game developed and published 
by Data East on the Neo Geo arcade system in order to do a tribute to the original game.

The context of the project is a 5-member group assignment for the Project I subject from the 1st year 
of the Degree on Videogame Design & Development imparted by CITM - UPC (Terrassa, Spain).

## About the game

Windjammers was released in 1994 by DataEast on the NEO GEO console and arcade system, and in Japan it was known as Flying Power Disc. 

It's a sports arcade game that consists of two players versus each other (or a player vs the CPU) in a 2 dimensional field, similar to air hockey or the famous video
game Pong, from which they take its mechanics. 

However, this game brings more movement freedom to the player and new mechanics such as the special throws or movable
obstacles throughout the court.
